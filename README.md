## Intenational-debt-analysis-with-SQL 📈📊

This notebook represent my work on a Datacamp project , it is about analysis statistically the international debt data provided by the World Bank dataset.
I used SQL queries in order to get a sense of the global economic state and get an idea about the debt categories where countries in the world take the largest
amount of debt.
Happy coding 👩🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻
